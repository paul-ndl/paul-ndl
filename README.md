# Hi there, I'm Paul! 👋

### Who am I?

I'm just an average computer science student, trying to survive my first year of a master's degree at EPFL while also managing to squeeze in some coding on the side. When I'm not buried in textbooks, you can find me tinkering with new technologies or contributing to open source projects.

When I'm not busy saving the world (or debugging code), you can find me playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with friends, and indulging in my nerdy passions.

Feel free to take a look around my profile, and if you have any cool project ideas or just want to chat about code, don't hesitate to reach out!

👨‍💻 : I'm currently working on the development of the Jiyi application
